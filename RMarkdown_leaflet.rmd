```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Problem

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library (leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet () %>% 
    addTiles() %>%
    addMarkers(lat=-4.306579, lng=15.297951, popup="Population explosion")
my_map
```
